 	<p>It is important to use a range of tenses during your speaking and writing tests to show the examiner that you have a good and flexible knowledge of grammar. I have included the main uses of the tenses below, there are other less frequent uses of the tenses but I have excluded them, as the ones below will be sufficient up to band 7.5.</p>

    <p>It is essential to understand what a time period is. <b>A time period is a length of time</b>, there are three main time periods, present, past and future.  Each of these is sub-divided into two time periods, a simple time period and a perfect time period. Now here is the important thing to remember: they are not tenses, they are time periods. <u>Time periods are associated with time; tenses tell us which time period a verb is being associated with</u> - remember this difference, it is very important. It is these six time periods which we must understand because each of them has two verb tenses associated with it: a simple and a continuous.</p>

    <p>The tenses therefore look like this:</p>
