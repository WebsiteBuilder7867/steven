      <p>These three grammar structures are easy to use and include in your IELTS speaking and writing tests to show the examiner that you know and can use grammar structures effectively.</p>
	    <p>I used to = I did in the past (regularly or often), but I do not do now. = я сделал в прошедшее, но я делаю сейчас.<br> eg. I used to smoke, but I don't now.</p>  
	    <p>I am used to = I am accustomed to = я привык<br> eg. I am used to waking up early in the morning.</p>
	    <p>I am getting used to = I am in the process of becoming accustomed = я в просессе привыкание = я привыкаю.<br> eg. I am getting used to waking up early in the morning.</p>
      <p>Did you use to play football when you were a child? - when talking about the past using did or didn't, we drop the "ed" and say "use to."</p>
      <p>I used a washing machine to wash my clothes - entirely different meaning to the above, here we are using the word use in the past tense. In the present - I use a washing machine to clean my clothes.</p>
	    <p>Note: these terms are often used incorrectly by native speakers, so don't be too concerned if you make a mistake.</p>
